Story:
Welcome the Kiosk project. The goal of this app is to solve the problem of keeping track of product inventories for business. Majority of businesses today in Nigeria make use of pen and paper to keep record of their product inventory, sales and monitor incoming products. The problem with this is that it is not scalable in the long run, especially when your business begins to grow. With this app users can be able to keep track of product inventories for their businesses which is then stored in the cloud (#firebase), monitor sales (daily,weekly and monthly), keep track of debtors, notify users on products that are about to expire which are on their shelf and much more (as the project expands). With all this features inplace, the plan aims to help businesses better manage their resources and provide analytics that'll will help the business owner grow and scale their business.
